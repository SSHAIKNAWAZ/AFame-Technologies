# Iris Flower Classification and Sales Price Prediction Projects

Welcome to my project portfolio featuring the Iris Flower Classification and Sales Price Prediction projects. These projects were completed during my internship at Afame Technologies, demonstrating my skills in data analysis and machine learning.

## 1. Iris Flower Classification Project

### Objective
Classify iris flowers into different species based on petal and sepal dimensions.

### Skills Utilized
- Supervised learning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Classification algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees)

### Technologies Used
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook for development and visualization

### Project Details
- Implemented various classification algorithms to predict iris flower species.
- Conducted EDA to understand the relationships between flower dimensions and species.
- Achieved accurate classification using machine learning models.

### Files
- `IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code and analysis.
- `README.md`: Detailed documentation including installation instructions, usage guidelines, and project insights.

## 2. Sales Price Prediction Project

### Objective
Predict sales prices based on various features such as area, location, and property type.

### Skills Utilized
- Regression modeling
- Feature engineering
- Model evaluation and optimization

### Technologies Used
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook for development and visualization

### Project Details
- Developed regression models to forecast property prices.
